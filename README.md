<ul>Abstraction classes can't be used to create an object, it must be inherit from another class.If we make any of the abstract method then we have to implement it into a subclass.</ul>
<ul>get and set methods are used to access and update the value of a private variable.</ul>
<ul>If we used static, then there is no need to create an object to access that variable or method.</ul>
<ul>If we used final before any variable or function, then it cannot be inherit, modify or overridden.</ul>
